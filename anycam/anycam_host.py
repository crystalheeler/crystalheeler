"""Late binding between camera_discovery.py and the modules split from it.

camera_discovery.py is the entry point and imports the other modules, so
they cannot import it back: a second copy of it would load, with its own
separate cameras and state. Two mechanisms connect them the other way:

  NEEDS  each module lists the camera_discovery.py names it uses. bind() sets
         those names on the module once, at start-up. Right for functions and
         for objects that are changed in place (CAMERAS, the logger).
  H      reads a camera_discovery.py value at the moment of use. Needed for
         a value that file replaces while it runs. Since 3.0.0-rc1.5 no
         module uses it: the focused camera moved to anycam_focus.py. Every
         split file still imports H, for the next value that needs it.

The release gate fails if a NEEDS name is one that is replaced at run time.
