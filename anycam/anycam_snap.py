    When CFG_FAST_STREAM_START is on AND a HW decoder is selected AND
    we're in Enhanced View (native_res=True), snap_loop launches a
    second ffmpeg (HW) in parallel with the primary (SW) one. The
    SW proc serves frames immediately (~1s); this task watches the
    HW proc's stdout, waits for the first complete JPEG (proves the
    HW decoder warmed up and the camera is delivering valid data),
    then signals the main loop to swap state["proc"] from the SW
    to the HW proc.

    State protocol (all keys read/written under state):
      state["proc_hw"]: the HW ffmpeg proc (set by snap_loop before
        creating this task).
      state["hw_ready"]: set True by us when first HW JPEG seen.

        producing a frame, or the timeout fired.
      state["hw_swapped"]: set True by the main loop when it has
        consumed our signal and swapped procs. We then continue
        draining the HW proc's stdout briefly (to prevent pipe-fill
        before the main loop takes over) and exit.

    The timeout (30s) is much longer than the rc2.5 single-proc HW
    warmup (10s). Reason: fast_stream_start is a "best effort"
    upgrade — if HW takes longer than usual, we just stay on SW
    for the session instead of disrupting the user's view. The
    rc2.5 10s timeout exists to bound the "I'm watching a frozen
    thumbnail" window; with fast_stream_start that window is gone
    (SW serves frames during warmup), so HW slowness is invisible.
