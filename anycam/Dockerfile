# 2.6.0-rc2.0: pinned-version build with ffmpeg sourced from
# archive.raspberrypi.com so we get the v4l2-request HEVC patches that
# light up Pi 4 / Pi 5 rpivid hardware decode. Everything else stays
# from Debian Bookworm. apt-pinning enforces the split: only ffmpeg
# and its libav siblings come from rpios; every other package
# (including transitive deps) comes from Debian.
#
# === Pinned versions (the contract this Dockerfile enforces) ===
#
# Debian Bookworm packages:
#   python3=3.11.2-1+b1
#   python3-pip=23.0.1+dfsg-1+deb12u1
#   nmap=7.93+dfsg1-1
#   net-tools=2.10-0.1+deb12u2
#   iproute2=6.1.0-3
#
# Raspberry Pi OS packages (aarch64 only):
#   ffmpeg — intentionally NOT version-pinned as of 2.6.2. See the long
#   comment above the install step for why, and do not re-pin it.
#   (libavcodec59, libavformat59, libavfilter8, libavdevice59,
#    libavutil57, libswscale6, libswresample4, libpostproc56 follow
#    ffmpeg's own Depends, and the step-1 apt preferences hold them to
#    the same Raspberry Pi Foundation origin)
#
# PyPI packages:
#   aiohttp==3.13.5
#   cryptography==48.0.0
#   asyncssh==2.23.1, typing_extensions==4.16.0 (3.6.0: SFTP upload; 2.23.1 is
#   the newest asyncssh that accepts cryptography 48.0.0, 2.24.x needs 48.0.1)
#
# If any of these versions has rotated out of its source repo by the
# time this Dockerfile is built, apt or pip will fail loudly and we
# bump to the new current version in a follow-up rc. That's the
# pinning contract: known versions, fail-loud on drift.
#
# === aarch64 / amd64 split ===
#
# aarch64 builds add archive.raspberrypi.com as a secondary apt source
# and use apt-pinning to source ffmpeg + libav* from there. amd64
# builds skip the rpios source entirely and use Debian's own ffmpeg —
# there's no rpivid hardware on x86 to drive, so the v4l2-request
# patches are irrelevant. Net effect: amd64 image stays small and
# Debian-pure; aarch64 image gains one external source pinned to
# specific package versions.

# Step 1: on aarch64, register archive.raspberrypi.com as a secondary
# apt source with its signing key trusted, plus apt-preferences pinning
# that allows ONLY ffmpeg + libav* to be installed from it. Every
# other package on the system (including any deps that happen to also
# exist in rpios) comes from Debian via Pin-Priority.

# Step 2: install the dependency set.
#
# 2.6.0-rc2.3 — pin lock-in. Versions for ffmpeg and python3-pip
# captured from the 2.6.0-rc2.1 discovery build log on CrystalHeeler's Pi 4
# (Pi-with-rpivid system). All 8 dependency pins now strict; if any
# rotates out by build time, apt or pip fails loudly and we bump in
# a follow-up rc. No more no-version-constraint installs.
#
# 2.6.2 — ffmpeg is now the single exception to the rule above. This is
# deliberate. Do not restore an exact ffmpeg pin.
#
# An exact ffmpeg pin cannot hold. Debian and the Raspberry Pi archive
# both keep only the current version of any package, so each point
# release deletes the version we pinned to. 2.6.1 could not build at
# all: apt reported
#     E: Version '8:5.1.8-0+deb12u1+rpt1' for 'ffmpeg' was not found
# because upstream had replaced it with 8:5.1.9-0+deb12u1+rpt1. The
# amd64 pin had rotated the same way, 7:5.1.8 to 7:5.1.9, and would
# have failed on the next amd64 build.
#
# ffmpeg is still constrained, by source rather than by version. The
# apt preferences file written in step 1 gives ffmpeg and every
# libav* / libsw* / libpostproc* sibling Pin-Priority 990 against
# o=Raspberry Pi Foundation, while everything else from that origin
# sits at 1. On aarch64 that forces the rpios build, because 990 beats
# Debian's default of 500, and the rpios build is the one carrying the
# Pi patches this addon needs for rpivid. On amd64 the rpios source is
# never registered, so ffmpeg resolves to Debian. Version floats within
# the bookworm suite, which bounds it to the 5.1.x series.
#
# The installed version is echoed below so every build log records
# exactly which ffmpeg that build received.
#
# Every other package here keeps its exact pin.
#
# 2.6.6: Pillow decodes camera JPEGs for pixel-comparison motion detection
# (camera_discovery.py, _motion_thumb). The standard library cannot decode
# JPEG. PyPI publishes Pillow 12.3.0 wheels for CPython 3.11 on
# manylinux_2_28 aarch64 and x86_64; Debian bookworm's glibc is 2.36.

# Exact version, verified by SHA-256. Unlike the apt archives behind the
